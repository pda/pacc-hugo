<h1>Ubuntu 7.04 Feisty Server &amp; Parallels - CDROM/Kernel Workaround</h1>
<h2>— Paul Annesley, May 2007</h2>
<p>Parallels and the Linux 2.6.20 kernel included with the latest Ubuntu release (7.04 - Feisty Fawn) do not get along well.  Firstly, the installer fails to detect the CDROM drive emulated by Parallels.  Then, if you manage to get Ubuntu installed using a workaround, the server kernel (vmlinuz-2.6.20-16-server) will not boot.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a workaround that I&rsquo;ve come up with to install Ubuntu 7.04 Feisty Fawn Server on Parallels (build 3188).  I installed it from the server ISO (ubuntu-7.04-server-i386.iso), but the same instructions should apply for installing Ubuntu Server from the full DVD ISO.</p>

<p><strong>Create New Virtual Machine</strong></p>

<p>Create a new custom virtual machine, with OS Type set to Linux : Other Linux kernel 2.6.  I gave mine 256mb RAM and an 8gb expanding disk.  On the Insert CD / CD Selection screen, use More Options to point Parallels at your ISO image.  Also, untick &ldquo;Start Linux Kernel 2.6 installation&rdquo;, as we need to work around the first issue before starting up.</p>

<p><strong>Switch to Solaris</strong></p>

<p>No, don&rsquo;t pack it in with Ubuntu completely.  Just edit your virtual machine configuration and change the OS Type to Solaris : Solaris 10.  You could have chosen Solaris during VM creation, but then your VM files would have been misnamed.  Switching to Solaris was suggested by a <a href="http://forums.parallels.com/post53852-5.html">Parallels Forums member</a> to work around the initial CDROM detection error.  I don&rsquo;t fully understand why it works - I assume it puts Parallels into a slightly different CDROM emulation mode.</p>

<p><strong>Start and Install</strong></p>

<p>Start your virtual machine, and get the Ubuntu installer going.  If you&rsquo;re installing off the server ISO, you&rsquo;ll just need to hit ENTER at the boot prompt.  If you want to install Ubuntu server off the DVD ISO, you&rsquo;ll have to type &ldquo;server&rdquo; at the boot prompt.  Proceed as normal, until you get to the message saying &ldquo;Installation Complete&rdquo;.  DON&rsquo;T choose continue just yet&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Roll Up Your Sleeves</strong></p>

<p>On the &ldquo;Installation Complete&rdquo; dialogue, choose &ldquo;Go Back&rdquo;, and then select &ldquo;Execute a shell&rdquo; from the menu.  Swap from the problematic server kernel to the generic kernel with the following commands:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">umount /dev/scd0
chroot /target /bin/bash
mount /dev/scd0 /media/cdrom
aptitude install linux-generic
aptitude remove linux-server linux-image-server linux-image-2.6.20-15-server
exit
shutdown -h now</code></pre></div>
<p>Make sure you STOP the VM before it starts to boot up again.  Reconfigure it back to Linux : Other Linux 2.6, and then start it up.</p>

<p><strong>A Few Errors</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve run through this process a couple of times, and upon booting up Ubuntu for the first time, I&rsquo;ve had a different set of errors each time, but none of them have been a problem in the long run.<br />
There always seems to be problems like this, but the seem to be safe to ignore.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">ata1.01: exception Emask 0x0 Sact 0x0 SErr 0x0 action 0x0
ata1.01 (BMDMA stat 0x66)
ata1.01: cmd a0/01:00:00:00:00/00:00:00:00:00/b0 tag 0 cdb 0x12 data 36 in</code></pre></div>
<p>On a couple of installs I also had filesystem errors, with complaints about timestamps being in the future.  I suspect this is to do with a dodgy realtime clock in Linux under virtualization.  An automatic fsck repair and reboot fixed it right up, and it hasn&rsquo;t bothered me since.</p>

<p>If and when Ubuntu releases a server kernel compatible with Parallels, or Parallels releases a fix for this issue, you should be able to swap back to the server kernel using aptitude.  As far as I can tell, there&rsquo;s no problem running the generic kernel instead of the server kernel.  Any thoughts?</p>
